# GordenSquareSoil

This repository contains the code that was used to analyse sequence data obtained from bacterial genomes collected in Gorden Square Gardens, London, UK. This data is presented in the 2017 paper by Acty et al., in the Journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 

Files in the repository include:
- processing of raw 2016 data to generate biom table
- processing of raw 2017 data to generate bioom table
- code used to merge the biom tables generated, summarize the merged table and core diversity analysis (alpha and beta)
- any additional analysis
- the summarized biom table, which outputs the value used for sequencing depth in core diversity analysis
- the mapping file, used in the core diversity analysis
- phylogenetic tree, used in the core diversity analysis
